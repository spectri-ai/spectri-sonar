## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

> **AGENT DIRECTIVE**: You are executing this command workflow, NOT modifying this command file. Follow the "Implementation Steps" section below to execute the requested operation. Do NOT attempt to edit files in `src/command-bases/` or rebuild command infrastructure.

# Create or Update Request for Comments (RFC)

**Command**: `/spec.rfc`
**Purpose**: Create, update, or resolve Request for Comments (RFC) to document pre-decision architectural proposals
**Usage**:
- **Create**: `/spec.rfc --title "Proposal Title" [--type "System Architecture"]` or `/spec.rfc` (interactive)
- **Update**: `/spec.rfc update <rfc-name> [--status "Converging"]`
- **Resolve**: `/spec.rfc resolve <rfc-name> [--status "Implemented"] [--notes "reason"]`
- **Graduate**: `/spec.rfc graduate <rfc-name> [--short-name "feature-name"]`

---

## What This Command Does

**Create Mode**: Creates a new Request for Comments (RFC) in `spectri/rfc/`:
- Date-based naming (RFC-YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md)
- Structured template (Context, Problem Statement, Proposed Directions, Decision Criteria, Open Questions, Prerequisites)
- Type classification (System Architecture, Process Change, Tooling Decision)
- Status tracking (Under Discussion → Accepted/Rejected/Superseded)

**Update Mode**: Adds a dated discussion section to an existing RFC:
- Inserts new `## YYYY-MM-DD: [Description]` section (chronologically, newest at bottom)
- Updates frontmatter (Date Updated, optionally Status)
- Adds contributor attribution
- Preserves all previous content (never overwrites)

**Resolve Mode**: Marks an RFC as resolved and moves it to the resolved archive:
- Updates Status to a terminal status (Implemented, Superseded, Resolved, Rejected)
- Adds status history entry with date and resolution notes
- Moves file to `spectri/rfc/resolved/`

**Graduate Mode**: Creates a new spec from an accepted RFC:
- Reads the RFC's context, problem statement, and chosen direction
- Creates spec folder in `spectri/specs/01-drafting/NNN-short-name/` with standard structure
- Pre-populates spec.md with RFC context (not a full spec — a starting point for `/spec.spectri`)
- Links the RFC and spec bidirectionally
- Optionally resolves the RFC after graduation

RFCs enable exploration and discussion of multiple approaches before committing to ADRs, preserving the decision-making context.

---

## When to Use This Command

**Use `/spec.rfc` (create mode) when**:
- ✅ Exploring architectural approaches with multiple viable options
- ✅ Documenting system-level changes that need stakeholder input
- ✅ Proposing process or tooling changes before implementation
- ✅ Need to capture "why we're considering this" before deciding

**Use `/spec.rfc update` when**:
- ✅ Discussion has progressed and you need to capture new thinking
- ✅ Options have narrowed or a direction is converging
- ✅ New information or decisions need documenting
- ✅ Status is changing (Under Discussion → Converging → Accepted)

**Use `/spec.rfc graduate` when**:
- ✅ An RFC has been accepted and is ready to become a formal spec
- ✅ You want to create a spec pre-populated with the RFC's context
- ✅ Moving from exploration (RFC) to execution (spec)

**Use `/spec.rfc resolve` when**:
- ✅ RFC proposal has been implemented (feature built, spec written)
- ✅ RFC has been superseded by a newer RFC or decision
- ✅ RFC was rejected after discussion
- ✅ Research RFC whose findings have been consumed

**RFCs vs ADRs**:
- **RFC**: Pre-decision exploration ("here are the options we're considering")
- **ADR**: Post-decision record ("here's what we chose and why")

---

## Usage

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)

```
/spec.rfc
```

Agent will prompt you for:
1. Proposal title (will be slugified for filename)
2. RFC type (System Architecture, Process Change, or Tooling Decision)

### Direct Mode

```
/spec.rfc --title "Spec Restructure and Docusaurus Integration"
```

Creates RFC immediately with specified title (defaults to "System Architecture" type).

```
/spec.rfc --title "Command Build Process Changes" --type "Process Change"
```

Creates RFC with specific type classification.

### Update Mode

```
/spec.rfc update spec-restructure
```

Adds a dated section to RFC-*-spec-restructure.md (finds by partial match).

```
/spec.rfc update spec-restructure --status "Converging"
```

Adds dated section AND updates the RFC status.

```
/spec.rfc update RFC-2026-01-17-spec-restructure.md
```

Full filename also works (with or without path).

### Resolve Mode

```
/spec.rfc resolve inbox-capture --status "Implemented" --notes "Implemented as inbox capture system spec and deployed"
```

Marks the RFC as resolved and moves it to `spectri/rfc/resolved/`.

```
/spec.rfc resolve deployed-spec-iteration --status "Superseded" --superseded-by "RFC-2026-01-24-stage-based-spec-folder-organization"
```

Marks as superseded with reference to the replacing RFC.

### Graduate Mode

```
/spec.rfc graduate inbox-capture
```

Creates a new spec from the RFC, pre-populated with its context and problem statement.

```
/spec.rfc graduate inbox-capture --short-name "inbox-capture-system"
```

Specifies the short name for the spec folder (otherwise derived from the RFC title).

---

## Implementation Steps

Follow these steps when executing this command:

### 1. Detect Mode

**Graduate Mode** - if first argument is `graduate`:
- Extract RFC name from second argument
- Go to "Graduate Mode Steps" section below

**Resolve Mode** - if first argument is `resolve`:
- Extract RFC name from second argument
- Go to "Resolve Mode Steps" section below

**Update Mode** - if first argument is `update`:
- Extract RFC name from second argument
- Go to "Update Mode Steps" section below

**Create Mode** - otherwise:
- Go to "Create Mode Steps" section below

---

## Create Mode Steps

### 2a. Gather Create Input

**If no --title provided** (interactive mode):
- Ask user: "What architectural proposal would you like to document?"
- Wait for user to provide proposal title
- Example: "Spec Restructure and Docusaurus Integration"

**If no --type provided** (interactive mode):
- Ask user: "What type of RFC is this?"
- Options: "System Architecture", "Process Change", "Tooling Decision"
- Default to "System Architecture" if user doesn't specify

**If --title and --type provided**:
- Use provided values directly

### 2b. Create RFC File

Execute RFC creation script:

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
RESULT=$("$REPO_ROOT/.spectri/scripts/spectri-trail/create-rfc.sh" --title "$TITLE" --type "$TYPE" --json)
```

Parse JSON result:
- `id`: Date-based RFC identifier (e.g., "2026-01-19")
- `path`: Absolute path to created RFC file
- `slug`: Slugified filename
- `title`: Proposal title
- `type`: RFC type classification

### 3. Provide Next Steps Guidance

Display success message with guidance:

```
✅ RFC-$RFC_ID created successfully!

   File: $RFC_PATH
   Title: $TITLE
   Type: $TYPE

📝 Next Steps:

1. Edit the RFC file to fill in:
   - Context: Background and current situation
   - Problem Statement: Challenges being addressed
   - Proposed Directions: Multiple options with descriptions, rationales, and tradeoffs
   - Decision Criteria: How options will be evaluated
   - Open Questions: What needs answering before deciding
   - Prerequisites: What must be completed first

2. RFC Structure Tips:
   - Document MULTIPLE options (at least 2) — a single-solution RFC is not an RFC, it's an implementation guide
   - Include tradeoffs for each option (pros/cons)
   - List open questions that need resolution
   - Keep status as "Under Discussion" while exploring
   - NEVER reference specs by number that don't exist yet — spec numbers are assigned by `/spec.specify` when created
     - ❌ Wrong: "See spec 051 for details" or "This will become spec 055"
     - ✅ Right: "See the planned authentication system" or "A future spec will cover this"
   - Remember the document type hierarchy: RFC (explore) → ADR (decide) → Spec (define) → Plan (implement)

3. Update Status When Ready:
   - "Accepted" → Create ADRs from chosen direction
   - "Rejected" → Document why proposal not pursued
   - "Superseded" → Link to newer RFC that replaces this

4. Commit RFC:
   git add $RFC_PATH
   git commit -m "docs: Add RFC-$RFC_ID for $TITLE"

📚 For guidance on RFCs vs ADRs, see: spectri/specs/04-deployed/030-rfc-module/spec.md
```

### 4. Error Handling

Handle common errors gracefully:

**Template not found**:
```
ERROR: RFC template not found at .spectri/templates/spectri-trail/rfc-template.md

This usually means the RFC system hasn't been set up yet.
Run: git pull origin main  # To get latest templates
```

**Script not found**:
```
ERROR: create-rfc.sh script not found at .spectri/scripts/spectri-trail/create-rfc.sh

The RFC system may not be installed yet.
Check: Is this a Spectri repository with RFC support?
```

**Filesystem errors**:
```
ERROR: Could not create RFC file at $RFC_PATH

Possible causes:
- Insufficient permissions (check directory write access)
- Disk space full
- Invalid characters in title
```

---

## Update Mode Steps

### 3a. Find RFC File

Search for RFC by name in `spectri/rfc/`:

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
RFC_DIR="$REPO_ROOT/spectri/rfc"

# Find RFC by partial match (case-insensitive)
RFC_FILE=$(find "$RFC_DIR" -name "*$RFC_NAME*" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -1)
```

**If not found**:
```
ERROR: No RFC found matching "$RFC_NAME"

Available RFCs:
$(ls -1 "$RFC_DIR"/*.md 2>/dev/null | xargs -n1 basename)
```

**If multiple matches**: List matches and ask user to be more specific.

### 3b. Gather Update Input

**Prompt for section title**:
- Ask user: "What should this update section be titled?"
- Suggest: "Converged Proposal", "Implementation Decision", "Revised Direction", etc.
- Example response: "Converged Proposal"

**Prompt for section content**:
- Ask user: "Summarize the key points for this update (or paste content)"
- User provides summary of discussion, decisions made, what's still open

**Convergence check**: If the update content describes a single agreed approach with no remaining alternatives, suggest to the user: "Discussion appears to have converged — consider updating status to 'Converging' or 'Accepted' if the direction is decided."

**If --status provided**:
- Will update RFC status in frontmatter
- Valid statuses: "Under Discussion", "Converging", "Accepted", "Rejected", "Superseded"

### 3c. Update RFC File

**Read existing RFC** and identify insertion point (before `## Status History`).

**Update frontmatter**:
```yaml
Date Updated: [current timestamp]
Status: [new status if --status provided]
```

**Insert new dated section** (before Status History, after any existing dated sections):
```markdown
---

## YYYY-MM-DD: [Section Title]

[User-provided content]

---
```

**Update Status History table** (add new row):
```markdown
| [Status] | YYYY-MM-DD | [Section title or status change note] |
```

**Add contributor** to footer if not already listed.

### 3d. Provide Update Confirmation

Display success message:

```
✅ RFC updated successfully!

   File: $RFC_PATH
   New section: "## YYYY-MM-DD: $SECTION_TITLE"
   Status: $STATUS (if changed)

📝 Changes made:
   - Added dated discussion section
   - Updated Date Updated in frontmatter
   - Added row to Status History table
   - Added contributor attribution

💡 Tip: Review the update and commit:
   git add $RFC_PATH
   git commit -m "docs: Update RFC with $SECTION_TITLE"
```

### 3e. Update Error Handling

**RFC not found**:
```
ERROR: No RFC found matching "$RFC_NAME"

Try:
- Check spelling
- Use partial filename (e.g., "spec-restructure" instead of full name)
- List available RFCs: ls spectri/rfc/
```

**Invalid status**:
```
ERROR: Invalid status "$STATUS"

Valid statuses:
- Under Discussion
- Converging
- Accepted
- Rejected
- Superseded
```

**Parse error** (malformed RFC):
```
ERROR: Could not parse RFC file structure

The RFC may have been manually edited in a way that breaks the expected format.
Please check the file structure matches the RFC template.
```

---

## Resolve Mode Steps

### 4a. Find RFC File

Same partial-match logic as Update Mode (section 3a above).

### 4b. Gather Resolve Input

**If --status not provided** (interactive mode):
- Ask user to select terminal status:
  1. Implemented — RFC proposal was built
  2. Superseded — Replaced by another RFC or decision
  3. Resolved — Concluded without direct implementation (e.g., research consumed)
  4. Rejected — Proposal declined

**If --notes not provided**:
- Ask user: "Resolution notes (or press Enter to skip)"

**If status is Superseded and --superseded-by not provided**:
- Ask user: "Superseded by which RFC? (filename or press Enter to skip)"

### 4c. Execute Resolution

Run the resolve-rfc.sh script:

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
"$REPO_ROOT/.spectri/scripts/spectri-trail/resolve-rfc.sh" "$RFC_NAME" --status "$STATUS" --notes "$NOTES"
```

The script handles:
- Updating frontmatter (Status, Date Updated)
- Appending to Status History table
- Moving file to `spectri/rfc/resolved/` via `git mv`

### 4d. Provide Resolve Confirmation

Display success message:

```
RFC resolved: $BASENAME
  Status: $STATUS
  Date: $TODAY
  Notes: $NOTES
  Moved to: spectri/rfc/resolved/$BASENAME

Commit the change:
  git add spectri/rfc/resolved/$BASENAME
  git commit -m "docs: Resolve RFC $BASENAME ($STATUS)"
```

### 4e. Resolve Error Handling

**RFC not found**: Same as Update Mode (section 3e).

**Invalid status**:
```
ERROR: Invalid status "$STATUS"

Valid terminal statuses for resolve:
- Implemented
- Superseded
- Resolved
- Rejected
```

**RFC already resolved** (file in resolved/ folder):
```
ERROR: RFC "$BASENAME" is already in resolved/

To view resolved RFCs: ls spectri/rfc/resolved/
```

---

## Graduate Mode Steps

### 5a. Find and Read RFC

Same partial-match logic as Update Mode (section 3a above). Read the full RFC content.

### 5b. Validate RFC State

- RFC should have Status "Accepted" or "Converging" (warn if "Under Discussion" but allow proceeding)
- RFC must not already be in `resolved/`

If status is "Under Discussion":
```
WARNING: This RFC is still "Under Discussion".
Graduate anyway? This will create a spec and mark the RFC as graduated.
```

### 5c. Determine Short Name

**If --short-name provided**: Use it directly.

**If not provided**: Derive from RFC title:
- Extract title from RFC `# RFC-YYYY-MM-DD: [Title]` heading
- Convert to kebab-case (lowercase, hyphens, strip special characters)
- Truncate to 4 words max
- Present to user for confirmation: "Short name for spec: `$SHORT_NAME` — OK? (or type a different one)"

### 5d. Create Spec Folder

Get next spec number and create folder structure:

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
SPEC_NUMBER=$("$REPO_ROOT/.spectri/scripts/shared/get-next-spec-number.sh")
SPEC_DIR="$REPO_ROOT/spectri/specs/01-drafting/${SPEC_NUMBER}-${SHORT_NAME}"

mkdir -p "$SPEC_DIR/checklists"
mkdir -p "$SPEC_DIR/implementation-summaries"
touch "$SPEC_DIR/checklists/.gitkeep"
touch "$SPEC_DIR/implementation-summaries/.gitkeep"
```

### 5e. Create meta.json

```bash
sed -e "s|\[ISO_TIMESTAMP\]|$(date -Iseconds)|g" \
    -e "s|\[AGENT_SESSION_ID\]|Your Session ID|g" \
    "$REPO_ROOT/.spectri/templates/spectri-core/meta-template.json" > "$SPEC_DIR/meta.json"
```

### 5f. Create Pre-Populated spec.md

Create `$SPEC_DIR/spec.md` with content extracted from the RFC. This is a **starting point**, not a complete spec — the user should run `/spec.spectri` to flesh it out.

```markdown
---
Date Created: [current timestamp]
Date Updated: [current timestamp]
Spec Number: [NNN]
Status: draft
Source RFC: [RFC filename]
---

# [Feature Title derived from RFC title]

> This spec was graduated from [RFC-YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md](../../spectri/rfc/[path-to-rfc]).
> Run `/spec.spectri` to develop this into a full specification.

## Context

[Copy the RFC's Context section verbatim]

## Problem Statement

[Copy the RFC's Problem Statement section verbatim]

## Chosen Direction

[If the RFC had an accepted/converging option, summarize it here. If multiple options remain, list the leading candidate.]

## User Stories

<!-- To be developed with /spec.specify -->

## Functional Requirements

<!-- To be developed with /spec.specify -->

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- To be developed with /spec.specify -->
```

### 5g. Update RFC with Graduation Link

Add a dated discussion section to the RFC:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD: Graduated to Spec

This RFC has been graduated to spec [NNN-short-name](../../spectri/specs/01-drafting/NNN-short-name/spec.md).
```

Update RFC frontmatter:
- `Date Updated: [current timestamp]`

Add Status History row:
```
| Graduated | YYYY-MM-DD | Graduated to spec NNN-short-name |
```

### 5h. Ask About Resolution

After graduation, ask the user:

```
Spec created at spectri/specs/01-drafting/NNN-short-name/

Resolve this RFC now?
  1) Yes — mark as Implemented and move to resolved/
  2) No — keep RFC active (e.g., if spec only covers part of the RFC)
```

If user chooses yes, call `resolve-rfc.sh` with `--status "Implemented" --notes "Graduated to spec NNN-short-name"`.

### 5i. Provide Graduate Confirmation

```
RFC graduated to spec:
  RFC: $RFC_BASENAME
  Spec: spectri/specs/01-drafting/$SPEC_NUMBER-$SHORT_NAME/
  Spec file: spectri/specs/01-drafting/$SPEC_NUMBER-$SHORT_NAME/spec.md

Next steps:
  1. Review the pre-populated spec.md
  2. Run /spec.specify to develop full user stories and requirements
  3. Run /spec.plan to create implementation plan
```

### 5j. Graduate Error Handling

**RFC not found**: Same as Update Mode (section 3e).

**Spec number collision**:
```
ERROR: Spec folder already exists: spectri/specs/01-drafting/$SPEC_NUMBER-$SHORT_NAME/

Check if this RFC was already graduated or if the short name conflicts.
```

**get-next-spec-number.sh not found**:
```
ERROR: Script not found: .spectri/scripts/shared/get-next-spec-number.sh

The spec numbering system may not be installed.
```

## Date-Based Naming

RFCs use date-based naming to:
- Provide chronological context (instantly see how old a proposal is)
- Avoid confusion with ADR sequential numbering (RFC-2026-01-17 vs ADR-0001)
- Enable natural sorting by creation date
- Highlight stale RFCs waiting for decisions

The slug (slugified title) ensures filename uniqueness even for same-day RFCs.

## Finalization Checklist

Before completing this command, verify:

- [ ] **Implementation summary created**: `bash .spectri/scripts/spectri-trail/create-implementation-summary.sh --spec "$SPEC_FOLDER" --scope "[scope]"`
- [ ] **meta.json updated** (when applicable): `bash .spectri/scripts/shared/update-spec-meta.sh --spec "$SPEC_FOLDER" --updated-by "[session-id]"` (Only update meta.json when command modifies spec state, not during implementation phases)
- [ ] **Work committed to git**: Commit using appropriate commands
