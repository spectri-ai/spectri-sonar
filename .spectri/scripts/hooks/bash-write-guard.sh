# bash-write-guard.sh — PreToolUse hook on Bash tool for Claude Code
#
# Purpose: Blocks Bash commands that could write to spectri/ artifact directories,
# using an ALLOWLIST approach. If a command references spectri/ (the artifact dir),
# it must be either (a) the spectri CLI, (b) a .spectri/scripts/ invocation, or
# (c) a known read-only tool. Everything else is blocked.
#
# Protects: spectri/ (artifact dirs: issues, specs, adr, rfc, coordination, research)
# Allows: .spectri/ (infra dir), read-only commands, running .spectri/scripts/
#
# Input: JSON on stdin with tool_name and tool_input.command
# Output: exit 0 to allow, exit 2 to block (with reason on stderr)
#
# Deployed to: .spectri/scripts/hooks/bash-write-guard.sh
# Configured in: hooks.json manifest under PreToolUse/Bash
#
# --- Known Limitations ---
# This guard performs static pattern matching on the command string.
# 1. Variable expansion: $DIR/spectri/... bypasses detection (variables not resolved)
# 2. Subshell indirection: $(echo spectri)/issues/... same reason
# 3. Shell quoting in arguments: grep "a|b" spectri/ may false-positive because
#    segment/pipe splitting does not respect quoted strings. Error mode is
#    over-blocking (false positive), never under-blocking (false negative).
# 4. Mid-session changes: Claude Code caches hook scripts at session start.
#    If this script is modified during an active session, the changes do NOT
#    take effect until a new session is started. Test fixes from /tmp, not
#    by modifying this file and retrying in the same session.
# These are inherent to pre-execution static analysis, not bugs.
# Defence in depth (Write/Edit guards, spec-folder guards) provides additional coverage.
