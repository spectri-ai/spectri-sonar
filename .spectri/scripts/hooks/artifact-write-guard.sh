# artifact-write-guard.sh — PreToolUse hook for Claude Code
#
# Purpose: Blocks manual file creation in known artifact directories,
# directing agents to use the correct /spec.* command instead.
#
# This prevents agents from bypassing command workflows by manually
# creating artifacts (issues, ADRs, RFCs, threads, etc.).
#
# Input: JSON on stdin with tool_name and tool_input
# Output: JSON with decision "block" and reason, or empty for allow
#
# Spec: spectri/issues/2026-02-13-agents-bypass-commands-copy-existing-files.md
#
# Known limitation: Claude Code caches hook scripts at session start.
# Mid-session edits to this file do NOT take effect until a new session.
